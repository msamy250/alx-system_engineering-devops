Infrastructure Explanation:

Firewalls:
Reason: To protect each server from unauthorized access and potential attacks by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.
SSL Certificate:
Reason: To encrypt data transmitted between the client and the server, ensuring secure communication.
Monitoring Clients:
Reason: To collect and analyze performance data, detect issues, and ensure the health and availability of the infrastructure.
What Are Firewalls For:

Firewalls are used to control and filter network traffic, protecting servers from unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, and other security threats.
Why Is the Traffic Served Over HTTPS:

HTTPS encrypts data transmitted between the client and server, providing data privacy and integrity, and protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
What Monitoring Is Used For:

Monitoring is used to track the performance, health, and availability of the infrastructure, detect and diagnose issues, and ensure optimal operation.
How the Monitoring Tool Is Collecting Data:

Monitoring tools, such as Sumologic, collect data by installing agents on each server. These agents gather logs, metrics, and events, and send this data to a central monitoring service for analysis and visualization.
Explain What to Do If You Want to Monitor Your Web Server QPS:

To monitor QPS (Queries Per Second), configure the monitoring clients to collect metrics specifically related to web server requests. Use the monitoring service to create dashboards and alerts based on QPS metrics to track and analyze the server's performance.
Issues with This Infrastructure:

Why Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level Is an Issue:

Issue: Terminating SSL at the load balancer means the traffic between the load balancer and internal servers is unencrypted, exposing sensitive data to potential interception within the internal network.
Why Having Only One MySQL Server Capable of Accepting Writes Is an Issue:

Issue: Having a single MySQL server for write operations creates a single point of failure. If the write-capable MySQL server goes down, the system cannot process write requests, leading to potential data loss and service disruption.
Why Having Servers with All the Same Components (Database, Web Server, and Application Server) Might Be a Problem:

Issue: This setup lacks specialization and can lead to inefficient resource utilization. It complicates scaling and maintenance because updates or issues in one component can affect the entire server. Additionally, it can create redundancy challenges, making it harder to isolate and manage different services effectively.
