Explanation of Elements:

Load Balancer (HAproxy):

Reason: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.
Distribution Algorithm: Round-robin. This algorithm distributes client requests sequentially across the servers.
Active-Active Setup: Both servers handle traffic simultaneously, improving resource utilization and redundancy.
Servers:

Components: Each server contains a web server (Nginx), an application server, a database (MySQL), and the source code.
Reason: Ensures redundancy and load distribution. If one server fails, the other can handle the load, providing high availability.
SSL Certificate:

Reason: Encrypts traffic between the client and server, ensuring data privacy and integrity.
Role: Enables HTTPS to serve www.foobar.com securely.
Monitoring Clients (Data Collector for Sumologic):

Reason: Provide real-time monitoring and analytics for the infrastructure.
Role: Collects data from servers to monitor performance, detect issues, and ensure availability.
How it collects data: Installed on each server, the client collects logs, metrics, and events, sending them to a central monitoring service like Sumologic.
Why Each Element is Added:

HTTPS: Encrypts data to secure communication between clients and the website, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
Monitoring: Ensures system health by providing visibility into performance, detecting anomalies, and alerting administrators of issues.
Servers with All Components: Provides redundancy and fault tolerance. Each server is capable of handling all roles, ensuring continuous service availability.
Issues with This Infrastructure:

Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:

Issue: SSL termination at the load balancer means traffic between the load balancer and the internal servers is unencrypted, potentially exposing sensitive data.
Having Only One MySQL Server Capable of Accepting Writes:

Issue: This creates a single point of failure and can lead to performance bottlenecks. If the MySQL server fails, the entire database becomes unavailable.
Servers with All the Same Components:

Issue: This setup can be less efficient in resource usage and scaling. It might also complicate management and updates as all services are tightly coupled on each server.
